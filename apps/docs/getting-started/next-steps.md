## Common Learning Challenges

Be prepared for these typical challenges and how to overcome them:

### 🤔 Formula Complexity
**Challenge:** Complex calculated columns with multiple dependencies
**Solution:** Start simple, build incrementally, use the formula reference

\`\`\`typescript
// Start with this:
formula: `IF([Status] = "active", "✅", "❌")`

// Build to this:
formula: `
  IF([Status] = "active", 
    CONCAT("✅ Active (", DATEDIFF(NOW(), [Last_Login]), " days ago)"),
    "❌ Inactive"
  )
`
\`\`\`

### 🔄 Data Sync Issues
**Challenge:** Data not updating or sync failures
**Solution:** Check connection settings, validate data formats, monitor sync status

\`\`\`typescript
// Debug sync issues:
const sources = await panelsAPI.dataSources.list(panelId, tenantId, userId)
sources.forEach(source => {
  console.log(`${source.type}: ${source.lastSyncAt || 'Never synced'}`)
})
\`\`\`

### 👥 Permission Confusion
**Challenge:** Users can't see expected views or data
**Solution:** Verify user groups, view permissions, and published status

\`\`\`typescript
// Check view access:
const views = await viewsAPI.list(panelId, tenantId, userId)
views.forEach(view => {
  console.log(`${view.title}: ${view.userGroups.join(', ')}`)
})
\`\`\`

## Quick Reference Card

Keep this handy for development:

\`\`\`typescript
// Essential API Patterns
import { panelsAPI, viewsAPI } from '@panels/app/api'

// Create data source
await panelsAPI.dataSources.create(panelId, config, tenantId, userId)

// Create base column
await panelsAPI.columns.createBase(panelId, config, tenantId, userId)

// Create calculated column
await panelsAPI.columns.createCalculated(panelId, config, tenantId, userId)

// Create view
await viewsAPI.create(panelId, config, tenantId, userId)

// Publish view
await viewsAPI.publish(panelId, viewId, publishConfig, tenantId, userId)
\`\`\`

### Common Formula Patterns
\`\`\`typescript
// Text manipulation
`CONCAT([First Name], " ", [Last Name])`
`UPPER(SUBSTRING([Email], 1, FIND("@", [Email]) - 1))`

// Conditional logic
`IF([Status] = "active", "✅ Active", "❌ Inactive")`
`IF([Score] > 80, "High", IF([Score] > 60, "Medium", "Low"))`

// Date calculations
`DATEDIFF(NOW(), [Created Date])`
`IF(DATEDIFF(NOW(), [Last Login]) > 30, "Inactive", "Active")`

// Math operations
`ROUND(([Total Sales] / [Total Orders]), 2)`
`([Base Salary] * 1.1) + [Bonus]`
\`\`\`
